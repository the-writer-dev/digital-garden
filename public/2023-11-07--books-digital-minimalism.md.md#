## 1st week

-   Spend one hour each day without device
-   Solitude plan e.g) guitar, books, walks in nature



## 2nd week

-   Stop using devices during downtime to distress, instead demanding activity is more restorative than passive consumption e.g) exercise
-   Real world interaction is far better than SNS activity e.g) cooking



## 3rd week

-   Be an anti-texter
